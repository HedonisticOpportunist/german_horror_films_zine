  <h1>A History of German Horror</h1>
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <h2>German Expressionism</h2>
    <p>
      German horror can be traced back to a genre called Expressionism â€” which is also known as Weimar Cinema. The Weimar Republic (1919 - 1933) was marked by political tumult. This, in turn, inspired a genre in cinema that led filmmakers like Fritz
      Langto embrace new methods of making films. German Expressionism is characterized by using visual distortion and overly excessive performances in order to highlight the inner turmoil, fears and desires of its era; in that sense, German
      Expressionism
      depicted the inner conflicts taking place in the 1920s German and offered its audience a chance to confront these feelings by watching them unleash on screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to evoke powerful emotions, German Expressionism relied on flat shapes and contrasting colors; the aim was not be visually pleasing but depict reality by making it widely distorted. German expressionists were inspired by painters like
      Vincent Van Gogh, El Grec and Edward Munch.

    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
    <p>
      Before WWI, French and Italian directors dominated the European film production. Cinema in Germany was beginning to grow popular as showcased by the number of movie theaters in 1914. However, this growth came to a halt with the social and
      economic devastation caused by the war.This halt enabled the US to come to dominate the movie making industry in the 1920s; the vast majority of these films took place Hollywood, California. Hollywood managed to produce 800 movies a year during
      that period.
    </p>
    <p>
      While American films were popular with audiences, their style was lighthearted and filmmakers were more concerned with profit than anything else. Hence, slapstick comedies, romantic dramas and swashbuckling adventures films were the dominant
      genres. Due to this, the films did not challenge the artistic boundaries of their medium.
