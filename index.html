    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
      While Japanese and South Korean horror films are well-known and have garnered a reputation for being more intellectually challenging than mainstream Hollywood horror films, German cinema is something of an underappreciated genre. In fact, it
      is hard to come across recommendations without doing research.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>About this Site</h2>
    The goal of this site is to offer people interested in the genre to learn more about the history of German horror in order to fully appreciate what makes these films what they are. Moreover, visitors can also check out recommendations that show
    the breadth and versatility of the genre. Beyond that, there is also a list of available viewings that take place across the UK in order to bring fans together and foster a culture of discussion / debate.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site does not exist in isolation. Guests are welcome to submit their own recommendation by either email or submitting this form. You can also sign up for a newletter regarding any events that take place in conjunction with the viewings.
      Please don't be shy!

    <h2>About the Webmistress </h2>
    I am an Austrian female who grew up with an ardent fascination for fairy tales. While fairy tales usually have a reputation for being lighthearted, the films I watched were often frightening and grotesque, teaching me that the world was not
    just all rainbows and sunshine. This early exposure to darker films led me to become an avid reader. One of my favourite author is Edgar Allan Poe due to the way his language evokes emotions of terror and suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always believed that fairy tales and horror come hand in hand. For every prince, there is a beast lurking in the shadows out for your blood. For every princess, there exists an evil stepmother poisoned by her own greed and lust to care
      for those around her. Evil is not just monsters and beasts, but humans who fall prey to their own delusions and vices.
    </p>
    <p>
      True horror is not about jump scares but exploring the hidden abyss in our society and ourselves. I think German horror offers a glimpse into that and that is why I am so incredibly intrigued by this genre.
